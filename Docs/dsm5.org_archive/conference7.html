Stress-Induced and Fear Circuitry Disorders
</font></font></font></h3>
<p>Prepared by Michael B. First, M.D.</p>
<p>The third diagnosis-related research planning conference in the "Future of Psychiatric Diagnosis: Refining the 
Research Agenda" series, focusing on Stress-induced and Fear Circuitry Disorders, was held on June 23rd and 24th , at 
the APA Headquarters in Arlington, VA.  Conference co-chairs were Dennis Charney, MD from Mount Sinai School of Medicine 
in New York City, and Gavin Andrews, MD from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, and invited 
participants included 26 scientists from the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>The conference began with presentations designed to provide overviews of the four DSM/ICD disorders covered under 
the rubric Stress-induced and Fear Circuitry Disorders:  (i.e., Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social 
Phobia [Social Anxiety Disorder] and Specific Phobia), specifically focusing on some of the diagnostic issues and 
controversies that have arisen since DSM-IV and ICD-10 were published in the early 1990's.</p>  
<p><b>Matthew Friedman MD, PhD</b> (Hanover, NH) and <b>Elie Karam MD</b> (Beirut, Lebanon) began their presentations 
on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with a focus on some of the problems and shortcomings of the current diagnostic 
criteria.  For example, the initial criterion describing exposure to the traumatic event has been criticized for being 
too restrictive (i.e., should suffering with severe medical problems or psychosis qualify as an event) and for omitting 
other symptoms occurring at the time of exposure (e.g., dissociation, disgust, physiological symptoms).   Furthermore, 
parameters such as the frequency of occurrence of required PTSD symptoms have a large impact on rates of PTSD and need 
to be looked at in a variety of settings.  In addition, requirements for dysfunction and for symptoms being present from 
the three clusters (i.e. re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance of stimuli associated with trauma, and post-trauma 
arousal) as opposed to requiring symptoms from only two clusters might not be essential (at least in some settings) in 
predicting the comorbidity of PTSD with other clinically significant mental disorders disorders such as Major Depressive 
Disorder.   Other areas in need of research include subsyndromal PTSD (is PTSD better characterized dimensionally?), 
complex PTSD (the validity of a syndrome occurring in response to chronic stress such as childhood sexual abuse or 
torture of political detainees) and possible cross-cultural variability.   PTSD can also be characterized as a disorder 
of memory in which traumatic memories either become indelible or else cannot be retrieved.   Although structural brain 
abnormalities (e.g., smaller hippocampal volume) are well documented, it remains unclear whether these findings are a 
risk factor for developing PTSD or occur as a result (perhaps related to chronic disturbances in the 
hypothalamic/pituirary/adrenal [HPA] axis).   Finally, since only a small minority of individuals exposed to severe 
trauma develop PTSD, research must focus on resilience as well as risk and vulnerability factors.</p>
<p><b>Carlo Faravelli MD </b>(Florence, Italy) and <b>Toshi Furukawa, MD, PhD </b>(Nagoya, Japan) next presented on 
Panic Disorder.  There are several important issues regarding the relationship between panic attacks, panic disorder, 
and agoraphobia.  Panic attacks, independent of whether the person has full panic disorder, have been shown to be a 
marker for greater severity of disorders co-occurring with the panic attacks, suggesting that panic attacks should be 
given greater diagnostic status, perhaps as a subtype that would be included other disorders (e.g., specific phobia 
with panic attacks).   Although the definition of panic disorder requires that panic attacks come on "out of the blue", 
evidence suggests that for the majority of patients, the panic attacks are preceded by mild phobic or hypochondriacal 
symptoms.   It may therefore be that panic attacks are better characterized as "unpredictable" rather than 
"unexpected."   Evidence that limited symptom attacks may be as disabling as full-blown panic attacks supports a panic 
spectrum concept in which panic symptoms are dimensional.   More research is needed to clarify the causal relationship 
between panic attacks and agoraphobia; DSM-IV adopts the view that phobias occur as a consequence of panic attacks 
whereas the European view is that phobic cognition precedes panic attacks, which then exacerbates the phobic symptoms.  
Although agoraphobia without panic is rare in clinical samples, it is much more common in community surveys suggesting 
that it may on a continuum with panic disorder with agoraphobia.  Evidence of high comorbidity between panic and bipolar 
disorder suggests that there may be two kinds of panic disorder: "neurotic panic," which occurs in association with 
anxiety and depressive disorders, and "bipolar panic."  Dr. Furukawa also stressed the importance of interoceptive 
hypersensitivity (fear of bodily sensations) and in-situation safety behaviors (subtle avoidances) in the assessment of 
panic symptomatology</p>
<p><b>Susan Bogels PhD </b>(Maastricht, The Netherlands) and <b>Murray Stein MD </b>(La Jolla, CA) gave presentations 
covering various aspects of Social Phobia.  Evidence suggests moderate levels of heritability for Social Phobia; 
however, there is even higher heritability of fear of negative evaluation and behavioral inhibition, traits that 
predispose to Social Phobia and other anxiety disorders.   Although rearing experiences influence the development 
of Social Phobia, the type of rearing that protects against social phobia in sensitive children is unclear.   Peer 
neglect also appears to play a role in the development of Social Phobia in some individuals.   Dr Bogels suggested 
research into possible new Social Phobia subtypes that might differ based on origins and treatment response.  The 
subtypes would be based on the content of the fear of rejection, including fear of being negatively evaluated because 
of bodily symptoms (blushing, trembling, sweating), appearance (hair, body shape, clothes), performance (sport, music, 
speech), and negative feelings about self (being boring, weak, stupid).   Dr. Stein noted that the current "generalized" 
subtype has better reliability than social phobia itself and has prognostic and treatment utility.   Additional research 
is also needed to help set the boundary with normality (i.e., shyness) based on harmful outcomes. </p>
<p><b>Hans-Ulrich Wittchen, PhD </b>(Dresden, Germany) and <b>Paul Emmelkamp, PhD </b>(Wassenaar, the Netherlands) 
presented on Specific Phobias.  Although the Specific Phobia subtypes have some clinical utility with respect to types 
of behavioral interventions, there is overall little evidence from etiological and experimental research that these 
subtypes are sufficiently different to support such a subtle distinction.  However, the number of different specific 
phobias an individual has or the presence of panic attacks may be a vulnerability marker.  Beyond diagnostically 
non-specific vulnerability-stress models, there is little research available about what causes specific phobias to 
develop.  Since onset is frequently pre-pubertal, retrospective data regarding onset of the phobias are problematic.   
Suggested conditioning pathways (for example the development of phobias secondary to exposure to traumatic event or 
secondary to learning by observation of others with phobias) seem not to be sufficient explanations. Family genetic and 
twin studies do suggest a modest genetic influence.   Specific phobias are the most common internalizing disorder in 
childhood and early adolescence.  There is a considerable degree of continuity of this disorder into adulthood, although 
not necessarily as a phobia. Spontaneous remissions of specific phobias are rare; generally most will go on to have some 
type of anxiety disorder.  Furthermore, 50% of individuals with specific phobia in early adolescence will develop a 
depressive disorder later in life suggesting that  specific phobias are a significant risk factor for adult depression.  
As is the case with the other childhood internalizing disorders, very few individuals receive mental health treatment 
for their phobias, although CBT for specific phobia is one of the most effective treatments documented. Treatment occurs 
typically after the development of secondary complications, usually the onset of a depressive episode. </p>
<p>The remaining presentations focused on topics that cut across the various anxiety disorders.   The first presentations,
 by <strong>Richie Poulton, PhD</strong> (Dunedin, New Zealand) and <strong>Danny Pine, MD</strong> (Bethesda, MD), 
 addressed the lifetime stability of anxiety disorders.   Dr. Poulton presented longitudinal data from the Dunedin 
 cohort, which was formed in the early 1970's and evaluated every few years from age 3 up to age 32: 60-80% of those 
 with a mental disorder at age 26 had a mental disorder at age 18.  With the regard to the stress-induced and fear 
 circuitry disorders, the study indicated continuity of the behavior over time, suggesting that it makes sense to 
 reframe most "adult" anxiety disorders as extensions of childhood anxiety disorders.   The Dunedin study also allowed 
 for an examination of the risk factors for the development of these disorders (e.g.,  the risk of developing PTSD is 
 related to early poor cognitive functioning, having a "difficult" temperament, and having been exposed to physical 
 abuse before age 11).  Of note, the stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders have both shared and specific risk factors and the specific disorders are distinguishable in terms of their early childhood risk antecedents. In his presentation, Dr. Pine noted that most adult disorders start in childhood but that most childhood disorders, especially specific anxiety disorders, are transient.  He suggested that research that aims to understand brain function and the genetic underpinning of childhood anxiety disorders (including gene and environment interactions) requires mapping brain  intermediate phenotypes (like behavioral inhibition and threat bias) rather than the anxiety disorders themselves.</p>
<p><b>Abby Fyer, MD</b> (New York, NY) and <b>Tim Brown, PhD</b> reviewed the genetic and epidemiological data 
addressing the issue of whether the anxiety disorders form a cohesive group that is distinct from other disorders.  
Traditional descriptive validity measures (e.g. age at onset, gender distribution, course, treatment response and 
comorbidity) suggest both overlap and distinctness both among the four anxiety disorders and between anxiety and 
affective disorders.   Data on heritability follow a similar pattern.  All anxiety disorders demonstrate moderate 
heritability, but twin and family studies provide, evidence for both  shared (i.e., a common "proneness" to develop 
anxiety disorder that is inherited) as well as specific genetic and environmental contributions.  These data are 
consistent with the hypothesis suggested by Steve Hyman in the Research Agenda for DSM-V that the different anxiety 
disorders will each represent clusters of illnesses with overlapping or even distinct genetic and non-genetic risk 
factors that converge to produce patterns of pathogenesis, symptoms, and course that have a close family resemblance.  
<strong>William Lawson, MD, PhD</strong> (Washington, DC) followed up with a presentation on issues of race and ethnicity, noting that 
there are differences in prevalence among certain anxiety disorders in certain minorities (for example, the NCS-R showed 
less prevalence among blacks) but raised questions about sampling issues (i.e., there is little minority representation 
in clinical trials or in biological studies).</p>
<p><strong>Jack Gorman, MD</strong> (New York, NY) and <strong>Thalia Eley, PhD</strong> (London, UK) addressed gene and environment interactions in their 
presentations.  Animal data provide a number of examples in which environmental interventions have a profound impact on 
genetically-determined temperament to produce significant behavioral and neurobiological changes.   For example, 
consider two species of macaque monkey: pigtail and bonnet with different behavioral characteristics, neurobiology, and 
rearing patterns.   The pigtail species is characterized by hostile behavior and higher corticotrophin releasing factor 
(CRF) levels and the mothers are very protective of their young, not letting them have any interactions with peers.  In 
contract, the bonnet monkeys are calm, have lower CRF levels, and are reared to encourage peer interaction.  Stressing 
the mothers of newborn bonnets (by exposing them to a variable foraging demand) results in the offspring acting like 
pigtail monkeys, demonstrating that exposure to a significant environmental stress can alter the natural course of a 
behavioral phenotype.    Of note, in contrast to animals where the negative effects of stress appear permanent, there is 
much more plasticity in humans; parents can correct for it.  Studying the interaction between genes and environment is 
important because of the known environmental stressors for anxiety and the fact that although genes for depression and 
anxiety are largely shared,  environmental effects are more specific. Gene-environment interactions can be studied 
indirectly by using twin/adoption data and more directly using molecular genetics approaches.  Of particular interest in 
humans is the serotonin transporter (SERT) gene.  Having a version of the gene with two short alleles is linked to 
alcohol preference, ACTH response to separation, and effects on amygdala when scary pictures are shown.  Furthermore if 
individuals with this double short allele are exposed to stressful life events, they are at increased risk for developing 
major depression, demonstrating how specific genes can interact with environmental events to produce psychopathology.</p>
<p><strong>Rene Hen, PhD</strong> (New York, NY) and <strong>Steve Hyman, MD</strong> (Cambridge, MA) presented on what 
is currently known about the neural mechanisms underlying fear and anxiety.  The relationship between genes and neural 
circuits is complex.   For example, mutations in the gene encoding the serotonin transporter  which is expressed in many 
brain circuits will have consequences in multiple structures, producing very different phenotypes than mutations in 
genes expressed only in a particular brain region like the amygdala or hippocampus.  Furthermore, besides gene-circuit 
interactions, there are also development-gene-circuit interactions; wherein genes are expressed in a particular 
developmental trajectory.  For example, the consequences of a commonly studied mutation in the promoter of the serotonin 
transporter gene appear to result from abnormal expression of this protein during development rather than in adulthood. 
Another example from the preclinical literature is the 5-HT1A receptor which when blocked during development results in 
increased anxiety in tests that are hippocampal-dependent (contextual fear conditioning) but not in tests that are 
amygdala dependent (cued fear conditioning) . It would be interesting to apply such behavioral paradigms to human to 
assess whether specific anxiety disorders are similarly hippocampal or amygdala dependent.</p>
 <p>There are several possible approaches for classifying anxiety disorders: by clinical similarities (e.g., symptoms, 
 signs, and course as is done in current DSM/ICD), by treatment response (which is treacherous, given non-specificity 
 of treatment), by etiology (risk genes and gene/environment interaction), and by pathophysiology (neural and 
 cognitive/affective processes that give rise to the symptoms and signs).  Although the latter two have clear 
 advantages over the current descriptive approach, it should be noted that multiple etiologies may produce similar 
 pathophysiologies which are not perfectly coupled to symptoms, signs, and impairment.  Furthermore, evidence suggests 
 that DSM/ICD mood and anxiety disorders have overlapping pathophysiologies, including the high rates of comorbidity of 
 between anxiety and mood disorders, sharing the same factor in factor analyses of symptom data sets, sharing genetic 
 risk factors in twin studies and in association studies, sharing developmental antecedents (e.g., behavioral 
 inhibition), and sharing response to antidepressants and benzodiazepines; all suggesting that DSM is not correctly  
 "carving nature at the joints" as originally hoped.   A better approach is to consider a functional view of the 
 emotion-processing circuits, perhaps defining anxiety disorders in terms of deficits in circuits that appraise the 
 survival relevance value of stimuli in the environment, activate appropriate physiologic, cognitive, and behavioral 
 responses, facilitate memory formation in multiple circuits, or produce subjective feelings and conscious cognition.</p>
<p><strong>Edna Foa, PhD</strong> (Philadelphia, PA) and <strong>Richard McNally, PhD</strong> (Cambridge, MA) 
presented on the role of cognition in the development of anxiety disorders.  Cognitive processes are mechanisms 
related to the detection, encoding, storage, retrieval, and utilization of information.  Cognitions can be divided 
into two kinds: evaluations, thoughts, appraisals, or beliefs measured through self-report and cognitive biases measured 
mostly by behavior elicited through experimental paradigms.  Cognitions are thought to play a causal role in the 
etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders via negative evaluations and cognitive biases.  Anxiety disordered 
individuals overestimate the probability and cost of negative outcomes in a way that is specific to their disorder, 
negatively evaluate neutral stimuli or responses; focus on threat information; and remember more negative information.  
Studies conducting longitudinal observations on PTSD patients demonstrate that negative post-trauma evaluations 
correlated with PTSD severity, with cognitive predictors accounting for 75% of the variance in PTSD severity compared to 
40% with other established variables.  However, without studies evaluating cognitions before the trauma had occurred, it 
is not possible to know whether negative cognitions cause chronic PTSD or are the consequence of it.  With panic 
disorder, high scores on the anxiety sensitivity index (fear of bodily sensations) predicted later panic attacks.  
Treatment studies examining differences between treated and untreated patients show a reduction of negative evaluations 
and cognitive biases.  These data speak more to mechanisms of maintenance rather than causality.  Finally, experimental 
paradigms that manipulate disorder-related cognitions influence symptom severity (e.g., perceived control during 
induction of panic-related symptoms reduces panic attacks in panic disordered individuals).   The data that most 
directly speak to the causal role of cognitions in anxiety come from experiments which induce attentional and 
interpretation biases and then measure reactions to stress.  Individuals who were trained to have negative biases show 
heightened anxiety during stressful events than do untrained individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Ron Rapee, PhD</strong> (Sydney, Australia) and <strong>Richard Bryant, PhD</strong> (Sydney, Australia) 
presented on the relationship of stress and psychosocial factors in the development of anxiety disorders. It is 
important to distinguish between distal causes (in which there is a long temporal period between stressor and effect) 
and proximal causes (in which there is a short temporal relationship); a lot of psychosocial causes that are distal 
are better considered to be vulnerability factors.  Overall, the extent to which stress induces anxiety will depend on 
vulnerability factors (genetic, cognitive, etc).  Prospective studies indicate importance of vulnerability factors 
influencing response to stressors.  Twin and family studies demonstrate that both shared factors (e.g., family factors 
in children) and unique environmental factors (e.g., exposure to trauma) are important but that shared factors are less 
important in adult anxiety disorders suggesting that different types of etiological factors may be involved at different 
developmental stages.  Furthermore, environment may be responsible for the specificity of anxiety disorders since 
genetic factors appear to be relatively non-specific.  Consistent gender differences have been seen in various countries 
for GAD but not Panic Disorder, suggesting that these differences are not likely to be a cultural effect.  There are, 
however, cultural effects on frequency.  Social phobia is diagnosed less in Taiwan and Korea than in the West but 
symptom levels of social anxiety appear to be higher in the East, which may reflect difference in perceived impact 
(i.e., social anxiety is seen as positive in the East by parents).   Regarding stressors, childhood sexual abuse has 
been linked with a wide range of disorders, including anxiety.  Peer victimization may be more likely associated with 
social anxiety disorder.  There is little indication that parent-child relationship factors are causal to any particular 
disorder; their effects are mostly non-specific.</p>  
<p><strong>Scott Rauch, MD</strong> (Boston, MA) and <strong>Wayne C. Drevets, MD</strong> (Bethesda, MD) presented on 
neural circuits and anxiety disorders, noting that given the early stages of research in this area, it would be 
premature to reorganize the DSM classification of anxiety disorders based on brain imaging results alone.  Human brain 
imaging will likely provide a critical translational bridge from animal research to clinical populations.  In animals, 
classical fear conditioning involves habituation, conditioning, and extinction, with the amygdala playing a critical 
role in threat and fear response.  In humans, the role of amygdala and hippocampus is analogous but although the 
prefrontal cortex is involved, the precise location of homologous subregions is less clear.  Indelible learning about 
threat-related stimuli involves amygdala and hippocampus; exaggerated fear responses primarily involve amygdala, 
impaired extinction involves prefrontal cortex and amygdala; deficient ability to suppress attention/response to 
disorder-relevant stimuli involves rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and contextual conditional and inability to 
appreciate safe contexts involves hippocampus.  To date, initial brain imaging findings in anxiety disorders suggest 
group differences in amygdalo-cortical structure and function.  Many of these findings, however, are not highly reliable 
or specific and further research is needed to disentangle neural substrates or risk.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Yehuda, PhD</strong> (New York, NY) presentation focused on the neurochemistry and neuroendocrinology 
of anxiety disorders.  There are currently no biomarkers for any of the anxiety disorders, although there is some 
evidence for alterations involved in stress when challenge strategies are used.   There are a number of possible 
reasons why we are not getting a clear neurochemical/endocrine signal that will support the fear-stress diagnostic 
grouping.  These include: 1) methodological artifacts (e.g., peripheral markers may not relate brain processes, study 
design issues like power considerations); 2) problems with the current classification system (e.g., over-inclusive or 
imperfect diagnostic criteria); or 3) possible flaws in the conceptual foundation (e.g., rather than defining PTSD as an 
abnormal response to extreme stress,  it may represent a specific phenotype that results from an inability to recover 
from the normal effects of trauma, perhaps due to inadequate glucocorticoid signaling that has pre-traumatic origins).</p>
<p>After these presentations, the participants formed two working groups (one covering Panic and PTSD, the other Social 
and Specific Phobias) which were given the tasks of identifying strengths and weaknesses in the current diagnostic 
criteria, identifying promising new hypotheses to make the criteria more valid, and devising a research agenda for the 
accomplishment of these goals.   Research agenda items that emerged from these discussions included: 1) examine anxiety 
disorder patients and perform morphometric analysis of amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex; 2) select cognitive 
paradigms that map stages of fear conditioning onto neural circuits; 3) correlate the imaging findings with patient 
symptoms and course; 4) collect existing family and twin data to examine genetic hypotheses about shared risk factors 
and symptoms; 5) based on imaging studies, design genetic studies of the most robust intermediate phenotypes; 
6) consider disentangling symptoms and signs from severity and impairment when doing studies of patients with anxiety 
symptoms; 7) conduct longitudinal epidemiological and clinical studies using multiple measurement domains including 
imaging, genetics, environmental and personality/other risk factors and identify predictors for continuation of 
childhood disorders into adulthood; and 8) identify new physiological measures such as blushing for social phobia.
</p>
<p>The conference concluded with a presentation by <strong>Edward Nunes, MD</strong> (New York, NY) examining the 
relationship between anxiety and substance use.  Evidence suggests that there may be shared risk factors (e.g., children 
with anxious/depressed symptoms may have a higher risk for subsequent substance use).   Furthermore, animal models of 
addiction demonstrate that exposure to stress increases drug self-administration and prompt reinstatement of previously 
extinguished drug-seeking behavior.  Neuroimaging studies of cue-elicited drug craving suggest activation of anterior 
cingulate and amygdala (brain areas involved in fear response).  The acute effects of many substances are anxiolytic or 
anxiogenic  (e.g., intoxication with alcohol, sedatives, opiates, cocaine, and other stimulants is anxiolytic, 
withdrawal from alcohol, sedatives, opiates is anxiogenic) perhaps providing a model to better understand neural 
mechanisms of anxiety.</p>
