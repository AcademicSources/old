Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorders Conference  
</font></font></font></h3>
<p>Prepared by Michael B. First, M.D.</p>
<p>The sixth diagnosis-related research planning conference in the "Future of Psychiatric Diagnosis: 
Refining the Research Agenda" series focused on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and other disorders that 
may be part of an Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior Spectrum.  Conference co-chairs were <strong>Eric Hollander, MD</strong>, 
Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, and <strong>Joseph Zohar, MD</strong>, Chaim Sheba Medical Center in 
Tel-Hashomer, Israel.  Twenty-three invited scientists from around the world participated in the 
APA/WHO/NIH-sponsored conference, which was held at APA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia on 
June 21 - 22, 2006.</p>
<p>In opening the conference, Drs. Hollander and Zohar noted that distributed throughout the various 
sections of the DSM are a number of disorders which, like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, are characterized 
by repetitive thoughts or behaviors.  These include obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), 
hoarding (not currently in DSM-IV as a separate disorder but one of the criteria for OCPD), Tourette's 
and other tic disorders,  Sydenham's and other PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders 
Associated with Streptococcal Infections), trichotillomania, body dysmorphic disorder, hypochondriasis, 
autism, eating disorders, Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, impulse control disorder 
(e.g., pathological gambling), and substance addictions.   Given potential commonalities in terms of 
brain circuitry, familial/genetic factors, neurotransmitter/peptide systems, phenotypes, and treatment 
response, it has been proposed that these disorders be grouped together under the rubric of 
Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders (OCSD).    Accordingly, the primary aim of the conference 
was to review the evidence that these disorders may be related to obsessive-compulsive disorder based on 
an examination of similarities and differences in terms of phenomenology, comorbidity, course of illness, 
and the additional domains listed above..  Other questions considered at the conference included:  1) Are 
there underlying endophenotypes that cut across obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders and clarify their 
relationship with anxiety disorders? 2) What is the best way to diagnose OCD and the other spectrum disorders?  
(e.g., are symptom dimensions helpful in the diagnosis of OCD?)  3) What are the strengths and weaknesses of 
the current criteria? and  4) How should OCD that occurs in other psychiatric disorders be diagnosed, 
(e.g., is there a case to be made for including a "schizo-obsessive" subtype for schizophrenia?) </p>
<p><strong>Naomi Fineberg MRCPsych</strong> (Hertfordshire, UK), focused on the definition of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder and on whether obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) 
should be included within the OC spectrum disorders.  The current definition of obsessive-compulsive 
disorder requires obsessions or compulsions.   Obsessions are defined as repetitive thoughts that are 
non-rewarding, ego-alien, resisted by the person,  recognized, at least initially, as excessive or 
unreasonable, and not due to a medical condition (ruling out PANDAS and other medical conditions that can 
cause OC symptoms).  Factor analysis of OC symptoms indicates that they can be subtyped according to 
their content into contamination/cleaning, sexual obsessions, doubting/checking, need for symmetry/ordering, 
and hoarding.  SRI-resistant OCD may constitute a subtype: in adults it is associated with longer duration, 
earlier onset, and co-morbid tics; in children it is characterized by comorbid tics, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and oppositional-defiant disorder.   When individuals with OCD are 
compared to individuals with other anxiety disorders using cognitive testing, OCD patients tend to do worse 
on tests of executive functioning than do patients with panic and generalized anxiety disorder.  In contrast, 
cognitive functioning in social phobia looks more like OCD.   Dr. Fineberg called for collaborative expertise 
integrating diverse fields to agree on a battery of tests and to systematically compare homogeneous OCD subtypes 
with each other and with related disorders.   She then examined the relationship of OCPD  to OCD.   OCPD 
accompanies a range of Axis I disorders, including OCD, eating, mood, and anxiety disorders.   Although it 
occurs frequently with OCD (i.e., 25-30% of those with OCD also have OCPD) and in families of OCD probands, 
OCPD is more commonly associated with depression (i.e., 70% of persons with OCPD have depression), weakening 
the argument for it being a specific vulnerability factor for OCD.  However, since OCPD and OCD are similar in 
terms of phenomenology, age of onset, course, heritability, comorbidity patterns and possibly 
serotonin-selectivity for treatment response, a shared etiology is plausible.</p>
<p><strong>Sanjaya Saxena, MD</strong> (San Diego, CA) reviewed the relationship between compulsive 
hoarding and OCD.   Compulsive hoarding is defined as the acquisition of, and failure to discard, 
a large number of possessions that appear to be useless or of limited value, leading to severe 
clutter that causes impairment or distress.  On the basis of phenemonology, comorbidity patterns, 
family and genetic studies, and neuroimaging data, compulsive hoarding syndrome appears to be a 
discrete entity with a unique and characteristic pattern of core symptoms, associated features, and 
neurobiological abnormalities that differ from OCD.  Dr. Saxena proposed that compulsive hoarding 
syndrome be listed as an OCSD in DSM-V with its own diagnostic criteria.  Future research needs include 
epidemiological studies to establish prevalence and gender ratio, family and genetic studies of 
hoarders that do not exclude hoarders without other OCD symptoms, pathophysiological studies, and 
treatment studies of non-SRI medications. </p>
<p><strong>Euripedes Miguel, MD, PhD</strong> (Sao Paulo, Brazil) examined the relationship between 
OCD and Tourette's syndrome (TS).  Among patients with Tourette's syndrome, 60% have obsessions and/or 
compulsions and 30% have full-blown OCD.   Among patients with OCD, 40% have had a history of a tic 
disorder.  Patients with OCD and tics as opposed to patients with OCD without tics have several 
distinguishing features. For example, patients with both OCD and tics are more likely to have an 
earlier age of onset, hoarding behavior, repeating rituals, tic-like compulsions, symmetry/ordering, 
and aggressive obsessions than OCD counterparts without tics.   Overall there is a phenomenological 
continuum of repetitive behaviors along the TS-OCD Spectrum, ranging from tics to compulsions.   The 
subjective experiences that precede these behaviors help in understanding the continuum; while typical 
compulsions are preceded by obsessions, tic-like compulsions are performed to relieve sensory 
phenomena (e.g., bodily sensations, general feelings, urges, or a need to repeat the behavior until 
reaching  an specific sensation or feeling "just-right").   Evidence supporting a close association between 
OCD and tics include similar clinical presentations; comorbidity patterns; course (e.g., tic in childhood 
predicts obsessive-compulsive symptoms in late adolescence and early adulthood); genetic data (e.g., rates 
of OCD are higher in first-degree relatives of probands with Tourette's and vice-versa when compared to 
first-degree relatives of control probands); and certain neuroimaging findings (e.g., involving 
cortico-striatum-thalamic-cortical circuits in both disorders and particularly the caudate nucleus).  Evidence 
that argues against an association with OCD include neuropsychological data (e.g.,, impairment in executive 
functioning in OCD but not in tics) and pharmacological treatment involving different classes of 
drugs (e.g., SRI's for OCD and dopamine blockers and alpha-2 agonists for tics).</p>
<p><strong>Dan J. Stein, MD, PhD</strong> (Cape Town, South Africa) presented on 
trichotillomania (TTM) and OCD.  Although TTM is classified as an impulse control disorder, 
Dr. Stein argued that it may be better conceptualized as a stereotypic disorder.  OCD and 
stereotypic disorders have some overlap (i.e., both have repetitive and ritualistic symptoms) 
but also have some differences (stereotypies are often driven by affect rather than by obsessions).  From 
a neurobiological perspective, while both OCD and stereotypic disorders may involve striatal dopamine 
systems, there are likely differences in neurocircuitry, neurochemistry, and neuropsychology.  Similarly, while 
dopamine blockers may play a role in the treatment of both conditions, SSRI's as well as Exposure and 
Response Prevention (ERP) are effective in OCD, while TTM responds to habit reversal.  Stressors and 
negative affect appear to create a vulnerability for stereotypies, leading to a pattern of behavioral 
addiction in which the individual gives into reward-based drives without regard to the consequences.  Dr. Stein 
concluded that although stereotypic disorders are not simply a subtype of OCD, there is some clinical 
utility to putting them in the same section as OCD.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Marsh, MD</strong> (Baltimore, MD) reviewed the evidence for obsessive-compulsive 
spectrum behaviors in Parkinson's disease, explaining that Parkinson's disease provides a model 
for psychiatric symptoms that occur in the context of neurological conditions.  An estimated 
80- 90% of Parkinson's patients have a psychiatric disturbance over the lifetime of the disease, 
some of which are prodromal to the onset of motor symptoms.    There is no consistent evidence for 
increased rates of OCD or OC symptoms in Parkinson's disease, which is in contrast to the higher rates 
of co-morbid anxiety disorders that occur in patients with Parkinson's.  There is, however, the concept 
of a "Parkinsonian personality" which pre-dates the development of Parkinson's and is characterized by 
traits of industriousness, orderliness, inflexibility, cautiousness, and low novelty seeking, which bear 
some resemblance to OCPD.    "Punding," characterized by intense engagement in purposeless repetitive 
activities like assembling/dissembling equipment, is associated with high-dose treatment of Parkinson's 
patients with dopamine agonists (14% prevalence).   Unlike OCD where repetitive behavior is intrusive, 
resisting, or rule-bound, punding is often calming to the patient. Finally, dopaminergic medications and 
deep brain stimulation used to treat Parkinson's disease are associated with the development of impulse 
control disorders such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, excessive spending, overeating, and abuse 
of dopaminergic medications. </p>
<p><strong>Katharine Phillips, MD</strong> (Providence, RI) examined the relationship between body 
dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and OCD.  Available data suggest that BDD and OCD have many similarities 
but also apparent differences. Shared features include many aspects of phenomenology; for example, 
both are characterized by intrusive, persistent, repetitive, and unwanted thoughts and behaviors. However, 
individuals with BDD have poorer insight (i.e., approximately 2% of OCD patients are currently delusional 
vs. 27-39% of BDD patients). Furthermore, compulsions in BDD (e.g., checking mirrors) appear less likely 
to reduce anxiety or distress.   From the perspective of comorbidity, 32-38% of BDD patients have had OCD 
in their lifetime, whereas 3-37% of patients with OCD have comorbid BDD.  BDD and OCD have many similarities 
in terms of comorbidity with other disorders and again, key differences. They have similar age of onset (in 
adolescence) and often-chronic course. Some findings from a prospective course study suggest that BDD and 
OCD are related disorders, although BDD often persisted in patients who remitted from comorbid OCD, 
suggesting they are not identical.  BDD occurs more frequently in the first-degree relatives of OCD 
probands than in first-degree relatives of control probands, suggesting that BDD may be a member of the 
familial OCD spectrum.  Like OCD, patients with BDD have impaired verbal and non-verbal memory which appears 
mediated by deficits in organizational encoding strategies, implicating cortico-striatal systems.  A 
preliminary mMRI study found subtle caudate abnormalities in BDD, supporting conceptualization of BDD as 
an OCD-spectrum disorder, although, unlike OCD, there was a relative leftward shift in caudate nucleus 
asymmetry and greater total white matter volume in BDD than in normal controls.   From a treatment 
perspective, like OCD, SRIs appear preferentially efficacious, but preliminary data suggest that 
augmentation strategies with typical antipsychotics that work in OCD may not be effective in treating core BDD symptoms.   Dr. Phillips noted that the inconsistent classification of delusional variants of 
nonpsychotic disorders (e.g., OCD, BDD, mood disorders, hypochondriasis, anorexia) should be addressed 
in DSM-V, perhaps by adopting a dimensional construct for insight (delusionality).</p>
<p><strong>Walter Kaye, MD</strong> (Pittsburgh, PA) presented on the relationship between anorexia 
nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) and the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders.  AN and BN 
are related disorders that tend to occur mainly in females and most commonly have an onset during 
adolescence.   AN has been viewed as a form of obsessive disorder since the 1930's.  Furthermore, AN 
and BN have a number of symptoms that have the qualities of obsessions or compulsions, including 
ritualized feeding, odd food choices, obsessive interest in diet recipes, window shopping in supermarkets, 
preoccupation with body image distortions, "compulsive" exercise (e.g., calisthenics) and  
fidgeting.   Other features that are similar to those seen in OCD include the ego-syntonic nature 
of the symptoms in AN, cognitive distortions in which the person focuses on details without seeing 
big picture, and impaired set shifting. Comorbidity between OCD and AN and BN is high, with reported 
rates ranging from 10% to 70%.  In addition, there is a higher rate of lifetime eating disorder 
diagnosis in OCD patients (8-12%) compared to the general population.   Rates of OCD are also elevated 
in first-degree family members of individuals with eating disorder (7-10%).  However, two studies did 
not find an increased rate of eating disorders in families of probands with OCD.   AN in particular is 
also associated with high rates of obsessive compulsive personality disorder (6-60%).   Obsessive, 
anxious, and perfectionistic traits tend to occur in childhood before the onset of AN and BN, and 
persist after remission of eating and body image symptoms.   Controlled trials show BN, and perhaps AN, 
respond to antidepressant medications but little is known about whether there is preferential response to 
serotonin-specific drugs.   Neuroimaging data suggests some shared brain circuitry between AN/BN and OCD 
but state and methodological differences confound comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Hollander, MD</strong> (New York, NY) presented evidence suggesting that autism may 
fit into the obsessive compulsive spectrum.  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with strong genetic 
factors (e.g., 90% concordance with identical twins).  One of the core symptom areas of autism is 
repetitive behaviors and compulsivity and there are elevated rates of OCD-like behavior in individuals 
with autism (e.g., up to 25% with contamination obsessions and 32% with ordering compulsions).  In OCD, 
there is a lifetime prevalence rate of 2.7% for Asperger's disorder, which is well above population 
estimates.  Among individuals with autism, there is evidence for heritability of repetitive behaviors 
(e.g. parents of children with high rates of repetitive behaviors are more likely to have OC traits 
themselves than do parents of children with low rates of repetitive behavior).  Genetic factors in 
autism and the repetitive behavior domain include linkage areas in chromosomes 1, 6, and 19 in an 
obsessive-compulsive behavior subgroup of individuals with autism.   Neuroimaging results include a 
correlation between increased right caudate volume and repetitive behavior.  Oxytocin may play a role 
in both autism and OCD; SRI's increase oxytocin levels in children with OCD and oxytocin infusion in 
adult autistic individuals improve verbal recognition of emotional tone.   From a pharmacological 
perspective, SSRI's are effective in decreasing repetitive behaviors and anxiety and improving global 
functioning in autism, similar to their effect in OCD.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Zohar, MD</strong> (Tel Hashomer, Israel), presented a paper outlining the empirical 
data supporting the possible inclusion of a schizo-obsessive subtype of schizophrenia.  He focused on 
individuals who have both OCD and schizophrenia and whose obsessions and compulsions are unrelated to 
the content of their psychosis.  Available data suggests little correlation between the severity of OC 
symptoms (which are typically moderate to severe) and core schizophrenic symptoms.  Fifteen out of 18 
studies revealed at least a five-fold elevation of OCD prevalence in schizophrenia compared to general 
population (e.g., ranging from a low of 3% to a high of 64% depending on patient setting and methodology).  
Higher rates of disorders in the OC spectrum (BDD, chronic tic, etc) also occur in these individuals as 
compared to schizophrenia patients without OCD.   Dr. Zohar noted that the prognosis of this schizo-obsessive 
subtype is worse than that of pure schizophrenia and that the OCD symptoms precede the first psychotic episode 
in about half the patients.   From a family history perspective, although relatives of both schizophrenia and 
schizo-obsessive patients have comparable risk for schizophrenia-spectrum, only schizo-obsessive have higher 
risk of OCD in their relatives.  On cognitive testing, patients with the schizo-obsessive subtype do worse on 
tests of executive dysfunction than do schizophrenic patients without OCD.   From a treatment perspective, 
combination of dopamine-blocker and SRI's are required.   Dr. Zohar concluded that although it remains unclear 
whether the high comorbidity indicates a pathological linkage between schizophrenia and OCD, it suggests that 
special attention should be given to this comorbidity.</p>
<p><strong>Lorrin Koran, MD</strong> (Stanford, CA) and <strong>Stefano Pallanti, MD</strong> (Florence, Italy) 
together discussed how well the impulse control disorders fit into a possible Obsessive-Compulsive spectrum. 
With the exception of intermittent explosive disorder (IED), which  is primarily a problem with anger 
control, the other impulse control disorders  can be grouped into self-soothing behaviors (i.e., 
trichotillomania (hair-pulling) or skin picking) and reward-seeking behaviors (i.e., pathological 
gambling, kleptomania, pyromania, compulsive sex, compulsive buying).  How good a  "match" each of 
these disorders is to OCD varies:
<ul>
<li><em>pathological gambling</em> is a fair match given some similarity in phenomenology 
(begins as ego-alien, and is intrusive and resisted), and course (usually chronic, sometimes 
episodic, with onset during adolescence), but heterogeneous drug response (responding to 
SSRIs, mood stabilizers, opioid antagonists and bupropion) as well as different brain 
circuitry goes against a close match with OCD; </li>
<li><em>pyromania</em> is a fair-to-poor match given the pleasurable nature of the behavior, 
differences in phenomenology (commonly occurs with dissociation) and lack of comorbidity with OCD. </li>
<li><em>kleptomania</em> is a fair-to-poor match given its different patterns of comorbidity, 
course, brain circuitry (frontal lobe), and treatment response (e.g., response to naltrexone 
and limited response to SSRI's); </li>
<li><em>compulsive buying</em> is a poor match given its different phenomenology, lack of OCD 
family history, and different treatment response (SSRI's are ineffective);  </li>
<li><em>hypersexuality (compulsive sexual behavior))</em> is a poor match given its focus on 
pleasurable activities, different brain circuitry (inhibition vs. hyperactivity), drug response 
(response to opiate and androgen blockers), onset (lack of prepubertal onset); and gender ratio 
(M/F 5:1);  </li>
<li><em>skin picking</em> is a poor match given the pleasurable nature of the behavior, its 
association with dissociation; gender ratio (F/M 2:1) and response to a different form of 
psychotherapy (habit reversal CBT instead of exposure/response prevention);   </li>
<li>nail-biting is a poor match given its ego-syntonic nature, lack of comorbidity with OCD, 
typical onset in childhood; and limited response to SRI's; </li>
<li><em>intermittent explosive disorder</em> is a poor match given its different phenomenology 
(often episodic and ego-syntonic), gender ratio (M/F 3:1), different brain circuitry (decreased 
frontal lobe and serotonergic activity), and its association with dopaminergic genes associated with 
aggression; and </li></ul></p>
<p>Dr. Koran recommended that diagnostic criteria be developed for the impulse control disorders 
not included in DSM-IV (e.g., compulsive buying, skin picking) based on an examination of large 
numbers of cases or of community subjects to determine essential criteria or to establish criteria 
that predict treatment response.   In the ensuing discussion, it was noted that the association of 
these disorders with OCD may differ according to subtypes of OCD (e.g., childhood-onset type) and 
that more thought needs to be given to the naming of these new disorders (e.g., should they be called 
reward-seeking behavior disorders?). </p>
<p><strong>Marc N. Potenza, MD, PhD</strong> (New Haven, CT) presented on OCD and addictive disorders.  
(A presenter from the Substance Use conference participates in every other conference to underscore 
the need for appropriate attention to the high comorbidity of substance use and other mental disorders.)  
The core components of addictive behavior include continuing the behavior despite adverse consequences, 
diminished control or compulsive engagement in the behavior, and a craving or appetitive urge to engage in 
the behavior, opening up the construct to behaviors beyond substance use, like gambling, sex, shopping, 
eating, and computer use.   Whether to classify these disorders as addictions, compulsive disorders or 
impulse control disorders is a matter of ongoing scientific debate.  A compulsion is defined as an 
irresistible impulse to act regardless of the motivation.  In OCD, compulsive behaviors are perceived as 
interfering, distressing, and/or bothersome, and are performed to relieve anxiety.   In addiction, there 
is a progression from impulsivity to compulsivity, so that the behavior becomes less reward-driven over time.  
Epidemiological data support a greater than expected co-occurrence of OCD and substance dependence (odds 
ratios from 2 to 4), but a weaker relationship between pathological gambling and OCD (odds ratio 0.6).  
Regarding clinical course, addiction is characterized by high rates in adolescents and young adults and a 
decline in prevalence over the age spectrum.  In contrast, OCD often has an earlier onset and lacks a peak 
with a rapid decline.  With respect to gender differences, addictions typically have a male to female 
ratio of 2:1 which differs from a 1:1 ratio for OCD.   Familial influences have been observed for a 
broad range of drug and behavioral addictions.   Some genetic factors have been linked to specific 
drugs and their metabolism (e.g., alcohol and ADH/ALDH alleles; CYP alleles).   Common genetic factors 
also may influence putative endophenotypes relevant across addictions, such as impulsivity, risk-reward 
decision-making, sensation-seeking, novelty-seeking, and stress-responsiveness.  Regarding the 
neurocircuitry of OCD and addictions, in addiction relatively greater emphasis has been placed on 
"reward-related" pathways, particularly the mesolimbic dopamine circuitry.   In OCD, increased 
activation of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry has been consistently observed.  The 
pharmacological and behavioral therapeutic approaches for OCD and addiction are largely different 
(e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD involves exposure/response inhibition whereas that for 
addiction treatment involves identifying internal/external cues associated with drug taking).   In 
summarizing his presentation, Dr. Potenza noted that OCD and addiction are largely more different 
than similar, but if divided into less heterogeneous groupings based on biological data, more 
similarities may be found. </p>
<p><strong>Trevor W Robbins, FRS</strong> (Cambridge, UK) reviewed cross-species animal models for 
OCD.  Animal models can be used in two ways, modeling a presumed etiological factor or modeling a 
particular symptomatic expression.  He noted that there can be effective animal models of psychiatric 
symptoms as long as these models are integrated fully with neurobehavioral phenotypes of disorders and 
a psychological theory linking it all together   Animal models need to be validated by treatment (e.g., 
clomipramine, fluvoxamine, other SSRIs, cingulotomy,  D2/D3 blockers like haloperidol) or genotype (e.g., 
COMT polymorphism).   Mouse genetic models of OCD work superficially at a symptomatic level and include 
disruptions of Hoxb8 in mutants leading to excessive 'pathological' grooming behavior and 5-HT2C knockout 
mice with  increased screen or clay chewing and perseverative head-dipping.  A wide range of repetitive 
behaviors have been hypothesized to provide a neuropsychology of repetitive behaviors.  Typical animal 
responses used to model compulsive behaviors include canine acral lick dermatitis, schedule-induced 
polydipsia, excessive wheel-running, and excessive grooming.   The presentation also covered cognitive 
aspects and neural substrates of perseverative behavior, particularly the task of attentional set shifting, 
as it occurs in both animal models and in humans.   Impairment in attentional set shifting is not only 
relevant in patients with OCD but is also seen in their first degree relatives. </p>
<p><strong>James Leckman, MD</strong> (New Haven, CT) focused on Obsessive-Compulsive symptom 
dimensions.  OCD is a consequence of the dysregulation of evolutionary conserved complex, and partially 
overlapping, neural systems that serve to detect, appraise and respond to potential threats across 
a number of dimensions.  From this perspective, each of the OCD dimensions focuses on some aspect of 
our lives; for example, had our ancestors not been concerned about contamination, they would not have 
been successful.   Factor analytic studies of OC symptoms from the widely used Y-BOCS Symptom Checklist 
have identified five dimensions: contamination-washing, harm-checking, hoarding, symmetry-ordering, 
sex-religion.   Preliminary data indicate that a dimensional approach to OC symptoms may be 
heuristically valuable for future genetic, neurobiological and treatment studies as well as 
being of practical importance to clinicians.  In response to critiques of the factor analytic 
methodology used to derive these dimensions (e.g., based on the a priori categories of the 
Y-BOCS), the DYBOCS was developed to measure symptoms within six dimensions: Aggressive; Sexual 
and Religious; Order and Symmetry; Contamination and Cleaning; Hoarding; and Miscellaneous.  
The factors emerging from studies of the DYBOCS are largely consistent with earlier studies 
using the Y-BOCS symptom checklist and emphasize several families of factors: a harm, sexual 
and religious factor; a Hoarding and ordering and symmetry factor, a Somatic/superstitions 
factor, and a Pathological grooming factor.  Dr. Leckman recommended that symptom dimensions 
be documented when diagnosing patients with OCD in DSM-V given their implications to prognosis 
and treatment response. </p>
<p><strong>Scott Rauch, MD</strong> (Charlestown, MA) addressed the neuroimaging and neurocircuitry 
of OCD and related disorders.   Brain circuitry in OCD involves pathways from cortex to striatum to 
thalamus.  Two pathways, however, run from striatum to thalamus; one, termed the direct pathway, 
amplifies activity in the circuit, while the other - the indirect pathway - suppresses or filters 
transmission through the circuit.  A variety of neuroimaging methods have been applied in a complementary 
fashion to yield convergent findings regarding OCD. Specifically, the nodes of this circuit (i.e.,  
orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and caudate regions) exhibit hyperactivity at rest, 
which is accentuated during symptom provocation and attenuated following treatment.   There are 
few candidate findings, however, that offer sufficient specificity and reliability to be useful 
for differentiating OCD from other disorders.  A dimensional approach may be informative in this 
regard.  Dr. Rauch suggested that imaging data could be used to support several of various options 
for restructuring the DSM.</p>
<p><strong>David Mataix-Cols, PhD</strong> (London, UK) presented on the neuroimaging and 
neurocircutry of the OCD symptom dimensions. He described an experimental paradigm in which 
subjects were exposed to images related to each symptom dimension (e.g., a photograph of a 
toilet seat for contamination concerns) and were given functional MRI's. Each of the 
studied symptom dimensions was mediated by distinct but partially overlapping neural 
systems. While both patients and controls activated similar brain regions in response 
to symptom provocation, patients showed greater activations in bilateral ventromedial 
prefrontal regions (washing experiment), putamen/globus pallidus, thalamus and dorsal 
cortical areas (checking experiment), and left precentral gyrus and right orbitofrontal 
cortex (hoarding experiment). These results were further supported by correlation analyses 
within the patient group, which revealed highly specific positive associations between 
subjective anxiety, questionnaire scores and neural response in each experiment. Based on 
these preliminary neuroimaging findings, Dr. Mataix-Cols concluded that OCD may not be a 
unitary entity; consequently,, using OCD as the benchmark to decide if a disorder is part 
of the OCD spectrum is complicated since OCD itself can be conceptualized as a spectrum of 
multiple overlapping syndromes.  Removing OCD from the Anxiety Disorders umbrella will 
require careful thought:  some OCD dimensions may be more like anxiety disorders (i.e., washing) 
whereas others may be more like neurological disorders (i.e., symmetry/order) and hoarding itself 
is heterogeneous (some patients are "compulsive" and others "impulsive").  He also recommended 
using the same imaging paradigms across patient groups in order to establish the common and 
distinct neural correlates of the symptom dimensions of OCD and the OCD spectrum disorders </p>
<p><strong>Susan Swedo, MD</strong> (Bethesda, MD) presented on neuroimmunological issues across the 
Obsessive-Compulsive spectrum, using Sydenham chorea (SC), one of the major manifestations of 
rheumatic fever, as a model of post-streptococcal OCD/tics.   The association between SC and OC 
symptoms has long been recognized, with up to 75% having obsessive-compulsive symptoms.    More 
recently, it has been recognized that a subset of children with OCD have PANDAS (Pediatric 
Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections). The five 
criteria for PANDAS include: the presence of OCD or tic disorder, prepubertal onset, episodic 
course of symptom severity; association with neurological abnormalities (e.g., choreiform 
movements during symptom exacerbation) and a temporal relationship between symptom exacerbation 
and streptococcal infections.  In the PANDAS subgroup of OCD and tic disorder, the diagnosis is 
made based on historical associations between streptococcal disease (positive streptococcal throat 
culture or a rise in antistreptococcal titers) and neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations.  A model 
for the pathogenesis of PANDAS proposes that Group A beta-hemolytic strep infects a susceptible host 
(only about 1 in 20 families are susceptible), leading to abnormal immune response with cross-reactive 
antibodies that target the surface of human neuronal cells.   The treatment strategy is to obliterate 
the strep and then prophylax against it.  Penicillin and zithromycin in prophylactic doses are effective 
in reducing number of strep infections and neurological sequalae.   Dr. Swedo questioned whether there 
might be other symptom complexes that represent a post-infectious neuropsychiatric disorder.  
Furthermore, PANDAS raises questions about how DSM-V should handle etiologic subgroups of disorders.   
In a complementary presentation, <strong>Euripedes Miguel, MD, PhD</strong> (Sao Paulo, Brazil) 
discussed additional research suggesting an association between rheumatic fever (RF) and OCD. More recent studies report high frequencies of OC symptoms, OCD, and tic disorders, not only in patients with 
SC but also in patients with rheumatic fever without SC. These psychopathological manifestations 
have been described in both the acute and chronic phases of RF (e.g, patients with valvular heart 
disease developed as a sequela of carditis). The presence of OC symptoms and tics in non-acute-RF 
patients suggests several possible mechanisms. First, acute changes related to RF might have 
persisted or triggered late pathophysiological changes that increase susceptibility to these 
neuropsychiatric disorders. Second, it is possible that OCD and related disorders such as tic 
disorders and RF share a common familial/genetic etiology.  This possible familial relationship 
was supported in a case-control family study that found that the rate of OCD/tics and related 
disorders such as BDD to be significantly higher among first degree relatives of RF probands 
than among first degree relatives of controls.</p>
<p>Next, three presentations looked at family studies and genetics.  <strong>Humberto Nicolini, 
MD, PhD</strong> (Mexico City, Mexico) presented on family and genetic studies of OC spectrum 
disorders.  Noting that OCD rates are elevated in relatives of probands with OCD, especially 
when there is comorbidity with tics and an earlier age at onset, he reported that they also are 
more likely to have the types of obsessions and compulsions displayed by the probands - for 
example, ordering, checking, and symmetry.  Segregation analysis, used to assess modes of 
inheritance, suggests that there is evidence of a single gene (autosomal dominant) for the 
following OCD subtypes: symmetry and ordering symptoms, OCD with eating disorders, and early 
age of onset.   Using linkage analysis, which provides etiological evidence for single gene in a 
disorder, two studies indicate involvement of a gene on 9 p24.  <strong>Gerald Nestadt, MD</strong> 
(Baltimore, MD) presented on familial approaches to addressing the question of what disorders should 
be included as OC spectrum disorders.  The prevalence of OCD in relatives of probands is clearly 
elevated; 12% in first-degree relatives, compared to 2% in relatives of normal controls.   For the 
anxiety disorders, there is no elevation in rates for specific and social phobia but there are 
higher rates of GAD, separation anxiety disorder, panic, and agoraphobia in first degree relatives 
of probands with OCD.  Controlled for the presence of these disorders in the probands, GAD and 
agoraphobia remain significantly higher in first-degree relatives, suggesting a strong relationship 
to the OCD phenotype.  While major depressive disorder is elevated (in contrast to bipolar and 
dysthymic disorders), it is no longer significant when adjusting for MDD in the relatives, suggesting 
that MDD in relatives may be secondary to OCD.  For other spectrum disorders, although there are 
elevated rates of BDD, hypochondriasis, eating disorders, and trichotillomania/nail biting in 
relatives, controlling for the presence of these in the probands indicates that only the 
relationship with BDD remains significant.   While there were higher rates of tics in relatives 
or probands with OCD, rates of OCD were not higher in relatives or probands with tics.  In his 
presentation, <strong>James Kennedy, MD</strong> (Toronto, Canada) discussed  candidate genes 
and subtypes in OCD.  The best candidate genes for OCD include 5HTTLPR and 5HT1B (related to the 
serotonin system) and GRIN2B and Glutamate transporter (related to the glutamate system).   
Regarding the symmetry/ordering subtype of OCD, candidate genes include 5HTTLPR and the glutamate 
transporter.  Finally, BDD is associated with the GABA-A gene and 5HTTLPR but not 5HT1B.  Future 
research directions, he suggested, include further exploration of the glutamate system that will 
iteratively refine phenotypes to genotype correlations, and combining genetics and imaging.  Once 
whole genome association studies become available in the next few years, it could conceivably lead 
to a kind of "fingerprint" for OCD based on dozens to as many as 100 genes. </p>
<p>Next, three presentations considered the nosological implications of different treatment 
strategies.  <strong>Herman Westenberg, PhD</strong> (Utrecht, Netherlands) proposed a 
pharmacologic dissection of OC behavior spectrum disorders. Noting that pharmacological 
treatments have a global effect on the brain neurochemistry and may work differently (e.g.., 
in different brain regions) in various disorders, he urged caution about making inferences 
from treatment studies.   OCD responds only to potent serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g.,  
clomipramine, venlafaxine, and SSRI's); norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as imipramine, 
and anxiolyics have been shown to be ineffective.  The effective dose of SRIs is higher in OCD 
than for most anxiety disorders and MDD, and the duration of time to onset of action is longer 
for OCD.  With respect to subtypes, symmetry and ordering, in contrast to washing compulsion, 
may respond more poorly to SRIs .  The effectiveness of SRIs in OCD, however, does not imply 
that there is a serotonergic dysfunction in OCD given that the response rate is less than 50% 
and that doses of SSRI's are substantially higher than necessary to completely occupy the 
5-HT transporter in most brain regions.  SSRIs at high doses may affect other neurotransmitter 
systems such as dopamine.  Evidence suggesting an important role for dopamine includes the 
observation that atypical antipsychotics can augment SSRI's in refractory patients; that 
neuroimaging studies show abnormalities in brain regions densely endowed with dopaminergic 
terminals; and that stimulation of dopamine by buproprion exacerbates OC symptoms.  Dopamine 
probably plays a central role in the pathophysiology of OCD, Dr. Westenberg, concluding, noting 
that certain disorders within the OC spectrum may best be understood within the conceptual 
framework of behavioral addiction.   <strong>Benjamin D. Greenberg, MD, PhD</strong> 
(Providence, RI) presented on anatomically focal brain probes and treatments in OCD.  
The relatively highly focal effects on brain circuitry make these interventions potentially informative for understanding pathophysiology and mechanisms of treatment response, although their effects may be more on traits associated with an illness.  One caveat in interpreting these results is that surgical candidates and general patient pools may differ meaningfully. Another issue is that different symptom dimensions or clusters within the categorical construct of OCD may respond differently to focal brain circuit-based interventions within an individual (e.g., for one patient treated with gamma knife capsulotomy, most OCD symptoms decreased, while hoarding symptoms increased). Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) cannot get deeper than cortex, in some studies it decreased compulsions and/or obsessions and improved mood.  Stereotaxic lesion procedures include anterior capsulotomy (for OCD, MDD, non-OCD anxiety), anterior cingulotomy (OCD, MDD, pain), and limbic leucotomy (MDD, OCD, self-mutilation with tic-like compulsions), and each has had some evidence of effectiveness (30%-70%) in open trials.  Deep brain stimulation also has been effective in some treatment-resistant cases and has the advantage of reversibility, adjustability, and suitability to controlled trials.  Interestingly, in a very small pilot study, a strong predictor of decrease in OCD severity and improvement in function after DBS response was the ratio of extraversion to neuroticism, two dimensions of personality, measured at presurgical baseline. <strong>Lee Baer, PhD</strong> (Boston, MA) reviewed research on the response of OC spectrum disorders  to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.   Since CBT is a catch-all phrase that has little specific meaning, it is important that individual treatment components be specified when reviewing study results.  Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is most effective for fear (or disgust) and avoidance in OCD-spectrum problems.  For OCD, it is most effective for washing and checking compulsions but less effective for ordering, superstitions, and hoarding.  Habit Reversal (including awareness training and affect management) is most effective in those stereotyped behaviors of OCD spectrum disorders that do not involve anxiety or cognitions (e.g., tics, skin picking, hair-pulling).  Cognitive therapy (CT) is a relatively non-specific technique effective in OCD-spectrum problems only when the patient has irrational beliefs underlying his or her rituals or obsessions (e.g.," if my face is not free of wrinkles I am hideous").  </p>
<p><strong>Soraya Seedat MBChB</strong> (Tygerberg, South Africa) and <strong>Hisato Matsunaga MD</strong> 
(Osaka, Japan) presented jointly on cross-national and ethnic issues in OC spectrum disorders.  
Epidemiological and clinical data on OCD and many of the OCSDs across various cultural and geographic 
settings suggest that this is a group of disorders with a good degree of trans-cultural homogeneity.  
Relative to the OCSDs, cross-national data are most robust for OCD with respect to consistency in 
rates, age at onset, and comorbidity.  Socio-demographic features and core symptoms are to a large 
extent independent of cultural, ethnic, religious and geographic differences.  Where standard 
instruments have been used, the symptom profiles of OCD and OCSD have been remarkably similar 
across countries.  However, the themes and course of these disorders may be shaped by cultural, 
ethnic or religious experience (e.g., religious themes in patients with OCD often prevail in countries 
where religion plays an important role in society, like the Middle Eastern countries).  Little is 
known about the mechanisms through which culture and ethnicity may affect the nuclear phenotype; 
this is an area where more work is needed.  To ensure better diagnostic reliability and validity 
cross-culturally, further studies are needed using internationally reliable instruments aimed 
specifically at comparing trans-cultural aspects (socio-demographic, clinical, and prognostic 
features) of OCD and the OCSDs.  Furthermore, future neurobiological and genetic approaches to 
studying OCSDs should incorporate an assessment of the interactions between culture and biology 
to allow for better understanding of its impact on the development and maintenance of these disorders.</p>
<p>Upon conclusion of the presentations, participants reconvened in two breakout groups to 
formulate recommendations for research and suggestions for future versions of the classifications 
of mental disorders (e.g. in the DSM-V, ICD-11 and others).  The first group, lead by Dr. Hollander, 
agreed that the data support five dimensions of OCD symptoms (Symmetry, Hoarding, Washing/contamination, 
Worries about Harm/Checking/Doubt, Taboo thoughts [sex and violence]) but questioned whether these 
dimensions should be used to guide treatment or are useful only for research purposes.  In considering 
what the criteria should be for deciding whether a disorder falls within the spectrum, the group agreed 
on the need for strong evidence from at least three out of the five domains (i.e., phenomenology, 
comorbidity, family history, fronto-striatal brain circuitry [e.g., caudate hyperactivity], or treatment 
response), with either family history or fronto-striatal brain circuitry required.  Based on this 
criterion, the group concurred that the strongest evidence for a relationship with OCD was for 
Tourette's, body dysmorphic disorder, and hypochondriasis.  There was also support for OCPD, 
hoarding, Sydenham's/PANDAS, trichotillomania, and eating disorders, and the least support for 
skin-picking and nail-biting.   The group also recommended that the DSM-IV impulse control disorders 
and the ICD's-NOS (including impulsive-compulsive buying, sex, and internet use) be grouped together 
into a new category called "Behavioral and Substance Addictions", or alternatively "Impulsive-Compulsive 
Disorders.  Possible subtypes of OCD to be considered include: "tic-related," "childhood-onset," 
"symmetry type," "hoarding type," "post-partum," "poor insight," "impulsive type," "inattentive typ,e" 
and PANDAS. </p>
<p>The second group, led by Dr. Zohar, recommended that, based on family studies, response to 
treatment, course, some biological markers, epidemiological findings, and brain imaging, OCD 
should be removed from anxiety disorders.   Regarding subtypes for OCD, the group agrees that 
the strongest evidence was for an early-onset type, for which PANDAS could be listed as a 
specifier (since all PANDAS cases are early-onset but not all early-onset cases are PANDAS).  
The group concurred that BDD, hypochondriasis, and tic disorders had the strongest evidence 
arguing for their inclusion into an OC spectrum grouping.  The group also proposed that the 
reward/impulse control related disorders (e.g., pathological gambling, trichotillomania) not 
be included in the OCD spectrum.   The group also suggested that the definition of obsession 
be revisited since not everyone with OCD experiences them as "intrusive" as is now required in 
DSM-IV.   Finally, although agreeing on the importance of increasing awareness of the comorbidity 
between schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder, the group was divided on whether a 
specifier for schizo-obsessive type should be added to schizophrenia.</p>
