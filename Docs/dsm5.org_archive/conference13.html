Dimensional Approaches in Diagnostic Classification: A Critical Appraisal 
</font></font></font></h3>
<p>Prepared by Michael B. First, M.D.</p>
<p>A diagnosis-related research planning conference focusing on dimensional approaches in diagnostic 
classification was held at the Natcher Conference Center on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland on 
July 27th and 28th,  2006.  The conference was the seventh in a series of 12 conferences on "The 
Future of Psychiatric Diagnosis: Refining the Research Agenda" convened by the American Psychiatric 
Institute for Research and Education (APIRE) in collaboration with the WHO and NIH, with funding from 
NIH.  Dimensional conference co-chairs were <strong>John Helzer, MD,</strong> from the University of 
Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, <strong>Helena Kraemer, PhD,</strong> from Stanford University in Palo 
Alto, California, <strong>Robert Krueger, PhD,</strong> from the University of Minnesota in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and <strong>Hans Ulrich Wittchen, PhD,</strong> from the Institute of Clinical 
Psychology and Psychotherapy in Dresden, Germany.  Twenty-eight invited scientists from around the 
world participated.</p>
<p><strong>John Helzer, MD </strong>(Burlington, VT) opened the conference with a description of its 
rationale and goals These were 1) to review the advantages and drawbacks of offering a quantitative 
"dimensional" component in DSM-V and ICD-11; 2) to discuss various alternative dimensional approaches; 
and 3) to discuss a research agenda relevant to designing and testing dimensional alternatives.   He 
stressed that the six diagnostic areas scheduled for formal presentation - i.e., substance use 
disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, childhood disorders, and 
personality disorders - were illustrative examples and that it was not the intention of the conference 
to confine discussion to these areas.  Dr. Helzer noted that although DSM-III was a revolutionary 
paradigmatic shift, the diagnostic progress it fostered revealed the inadequacies of a strictly 
categorical diagnostic model.  He then offered four recommendations for DSM-V: 1) that the DSM-V 
criteria should include options for dimensional approaches; 2) that the categorical approach of DSM 
should be retained given the ongoing need for diagnostic categories for clinical work and research; 
3) that the content of DSM-V dimensional components be determined by categorical definitions given the 
need to be able to relate the dimensional scales back to the categorical definitions; and 4) that 
DSM-V should be structured to ensure maximum utility for future taxonomic needs. </p>
<p><strong>Helena Kraemer, PhD</strong> (Palo Alto, CA) presented on the clinical and research 
contexts of categories and dimensions.  She first distinguished between the term "disorder," which she 
defined as "something wrong in the patient that is of clinical relevance," and "diagnosis of a 
disorder," which is an expert opinion that a disorder is present.    The decision to use a dimensional 
versus categorical diagnosis has nothing to do with the nature of the disorder itself but everything 
to do with the quality of the diagnosis for a disorder.   A dimensional diagnosis has three or more 
ordinal values, which can range from a three point scale (at a minimum) up to continuum (e.g., BMI for 
eating disorders).  A categorical diagnosis has only two possible values: present and absent.  
Further elaborating the purpose of the conference, she said the key issue is to consider whether to 
add a dimensional component to the DSM-V categorical diagnoses rather than to try to replace 
categorical diagnoses with dimensional constructs.   Every dimensional diagnosis can be made 
categorical by setting a cut-point; conversely, every categorical diagnosis can be made dimensional a
cross any of a number of possible dimensions, including - but not limited to - symptom count, symptom 
duration, symptom severity, degree of impairment, and certainty of diagnosis.  Dr. Kraemer illustrated 
the advantages of dimensional over categorical diagnoses in research settings by describing a 
randomized controlled trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy vs. self-help for the treatment of eating 
disorders.  The actual trial, which used the presence or absence of a categorical diagnosis of bulimia 
nervosa as the outcome variable, showed no statistically significant differences in the two groups.  
However, if a dimensional measure of frequency of binges and purges were to have been used instead, a 
statistically significant moderator effect would have been detected, indicating that the treatment 
worked in low-risk but not high-risk groups.   From a statistical perspective, advantages of using 
dimensional vs. categorical outcomes include greater power to detect treatment effects, less 
attenuation and greater precision in estimates of effect sizes, and better ability to detect signals   
Dr. Kraemer recommended that any proposed DSM-V dimensional diagnosis correspond well with the 
respective categorical diagnosis, be transparent to clinicians, and have clinical validity and 
test-retest reliability.  She concluded that the time to add dimensional diagnosis to DSM has come 
and that a dimensional approach is needed in order to prepare for the future inclusion of genetic, 
imaging, biochemical elements to psychiatric diagnoses.   A dimensional approach can be as simple or 
as complicated as is appropriate for each disorder, but most importantly, clinicians must be able to 
use it. </p>
<p><strong>Steven Haffner, MD</strong> (San Antonio, TX), an epidemiologist working in cardiovascular 
medicine, provided a perspective on the use of dimensional approaches in that field.  He described 
the rise and fall of the "metabolic syndrome," conceptualized as a combination of risk factors for 
predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Although the the metabolic syndrome concept is only eight 
years old it has already gone through three iterations.   The original definition of metabolic 
syndrome required three out of five factors (abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, 
high blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose).  However, because having fewer than three factors 
also is associated with an elevated risk of disease, while having more than three factors is 
indicative of a further increased risk, defining risk in terms of this categorical syndrome 
mischaracterizes people and loses important information.  Problems with the existing categorical 
definition of the metabolic syndrome construct include: 1) loss of data due to the use of dichotomous 
variables to define each component of the syndrome; 2) questions about the appropriateness of using 
these cut-offs in other countries with different lifestyles; 3) the differing ability of the 
components to predict diabetes and CVD; and 4) questions about whether the syndrome predicts CVD 
independently of its components.   Potential advantages of the categorical syndromal definition 
include 1) its utility as an operational definition for "cardio-metabolic" risk; 2) its ease of use as 
compared to multi-variate predicting equations; 3) its capacity to encourage providers to look for 
multiple risk factors in their patients; and 4) its tendency to encourage behavioral interventions 
(e.g., weight loss and increased activity) rather than treatment of individual risk factors.</p>
<p>At the core of the conference were a series of presentations centered on the clinical and 
scientific feasibility of dimensional models for specific diagnostic areas.  The first, 
by <strong>Kathleen Bucholz, MD</strong> (St. Louis, MO), reviewed research evidence for a 
dimensional approach to substance use disorders.  Dr. Bucholz noted that the change from a 
monothetic criteria set for substance dependence in DSM-III to a polythetic criteria set in 
DSM-III-R foreshadowed a dimensional conceptualization of dependence.   Summarizing 26 studies of 
alcohol use disorders, Dr. Bucholz reported that some of the early studies rejected the 
unidimensionality of alcohol symptoms, finding instead two highly correlated dimensions that 
reflected mild and severe symptomatology.  However, neither of the factors corresponded to the DSM 
construct of abuse.  More recent studies have provided strong evidence of the unidimensionality of 
alcohol items, with the consistent implication that alcohol problems lie on a continuum.  Furthermore, 
converging evidence indicates that some DSM abuse items are severe and some dependence items are 
mild.   Studies of other drugs (18 studies) support unidimensionality for some but not all drugs, with 
the findings varying by type of population studied (e.g., unidimensionality was not supported in 
problem users).  Two studies of nicotine suggest, however, that nicotine dependence does not appear 
to be unidimensional but instead yields two factors: one factor for failed cessation and the other 
factor for general dependence symptoms.  Dr. Bucholz suggested that future research investigate 
gradation within symptoms, examine weighting of symptoms, consider why findings might differ in 
clinical and population samples, reconsider clustering, investigate symptoms outside the DSM, and 
reconsider other aspects of dimensionality in addition to severity.</p>
<p><strong>John Helzer, MD</strong> (Burlington, VT) then offered an example of how DSM-V might 
accommodate a dimensional approach to substance use disorders.  He proposed a four-step process 
for DSM-V, beginning with the status quo (i.e., diagnostic workgroups creating categorical 
definitions) in recognition of the ongoing need for diagnostic categories for clinical work and 
for research.  The second step would dimensionalize each of the individual criterion items, ranging 
from simple 3-point scales that could apply across diagnoses (e.g., a severity scale of absent, mild, 
and severe) or a complex diagnostic-specific scale that could include laboratory values.   The third 
step would entail creating a diagnostic scale from dimensional items using statistical techniques such 
as factor analysis, latent trait modeling, item response theory, etc.   The final step would relate 
the dimensional scale back to the categorical definition in step one, using methods such as ROC 
analyses or logistical regression.  Dr. Helzer then proposed a more ambitious alternative which would 
entail developing the dimensions empirically from the "bottom up," using a mix of current criterion 
items and associated features which are not currently part of the criteria sets, including  behaviors, 
family history, biological test results, and other features of putative diagnostic value.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gossop, PhD</strong> (London, UK), reviewed several conceptual, technical, and 
practical problems raised by a dimensional approach to substance use disorders.   He noted that 
substance dependence is overwhelmingly the reason why people come to clinical services and he asked 
whether the current criteria for dependence are in fact correct and, more pointedly, whether there are 
specific core criteria which should be weighted.   He suggested that the criteria for dependence be 
geared to what clinicians need to know, namely whether there is a need to manage withdrawal symptoms 
and whether long-term treatment is needed.   A diagnosis of substance abuse, on the other hand is 
based only on harmful consequences, i.e., it is basically a problem-based conceptualization of a 
disorder.   Dr. Gossop argued that dependence on the one hand, and problems due to substance use on 
the other are fundamentally different concepts, each with its own management implications and thus 
should be kept apart.   Furthermore, the majority of people who seek treatment are multiple substance 
users, although the literature primarily focuses only on single substance dependence.  Is dependence 
on multiple substances simply a sum of two or more disorders?  <strong>Bridget Grant, PhD</strong> 
(Bethesda, MD), representing the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, led the general 
discussion  by noting that one cannot consider dimensionality apart from other nosological issues that 
have proven recalcitrant.   A researcher can take any disorders and throw the symptoms into an item 
response theory analysis and find dimensionality.  It is important instead to consider the nature of 
the disorder being measured and determine whether one is starting with the right criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Brugha MD</strong> (Leicester, UK) presented on dimensional approaches and mood 
disorders.  Key opening points were that a categorically-based classification does not reflect reality 
as evidenced in community epidemiological data; that having a single threshold for all clinical and 
research purposes is problematic; and that categories have a tendency to be reified naïvely.  Although 
clinical decision making is inherently binary (i.e., to treat or not), both clinical and 
epidemiological studies demonstrate that dimensional approaches to mood disorders may have advantages 
over diagnostic categories; for example, most subthreshold depressions predict later depression.   Dr. 
Brugha offered the NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) guidelines for the treatment of 
depression in primary and secondary care settings as an example of a marriage of categorical and 
dimensional approaches.     These guidelines use a stepped care approach that recognizes the different 
treatment requirements for different levels of severity of depression as defined in ICD-10.   In 
concluding, Dr. Brugha cautioned against making rules needed for levels of severity too complicated 
for clinical use.  Epidemiologists should use dimensional measures that can accommodate a range of 
disorder thresholds and categories.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Thase MD</strong> (Pittsburgh, PA) followed with a presentation in which he 
contended that symptom severity of depression is the critical dimension for predicting treatment 
response.  Although depressive disorders are heterogeneous, a unitary dimension of symptom severity 
conveys important descriptive and prognostic information.   As depression severity increases, the 
probability of clinical and biological correlates of dysphoric activation increases.  Clinical 
correlates of high pre-treatment severity include melancholic features, psychotic features, comorbid 
anxiety and neuroticism, borderline personality disorder, and suicidality.    Neurobiological 
correlates include hypercortisolism, changes in regional cerebral metabolism (increased activation 
of amygdala, decreased activation of prefrontal cortical structures) and increased peripheral levels 
of norepinephrine metabolites.    Increased symptom severity has important treatment implications 
including longer time to remission and recovery,  a lower absolute likelihood of remission or recovery 
within 6-8 weeks,  relatively lower likelihood of placebo response compared to antidepressant 
response, and a greater likelihood of response to combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy compared 
to therapy with either alone.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Andrews, MD</strong> (Sydney, Australia) considered various reasons that might 
explain why categories continue to dominate in the classification of mental disorders given the clear 
advantages of dimensional approaches.  One problem with categorical classification is that small 
differences in the wording of diagnostic criteria can lead to big differences in diagnostic 
concordance between different classification systems.   For example, according to the Australian 
CIDI data, which collected both DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnoses in the community, only two-thirds of 
individuals who met criteria for a disorder in one classification met criteria for the corresponding 
disorder in the other classification; factors primarily responsible for the discordance were 
differences in exclusion criteria and diagnostic thresholds.  Early hopes that external markers 
(e.g., laboratory tests) would validate categories has not born out.  With respect to the anxiety and 
mood disorders, Dr. Andrews said, genetic data is more compatible with a dimensional than a 
categorical approach, and it appears likely that ongoing research into fear circuitry and HPA axis 
pathophysiology will also support a dimensional approach.   Much of the current high rate of 
diagnostic comorbidity between depression and anxiety may be explained by the existence of higher 
order dimensions (i.e., both disorders appear to be part of a single superordinate dimension).  
Moreover, epidemiological data from community studies suggests that depression is best conceptualized, 
measured and classified as a continuously distributed syndrome rather than as a discrete diagnostic 
entity.  Given the numerous advantages of a dimensional approach, , encouraging clinicians to use a 
dimensional approach is a pressing question.   Dr. Andrews proposed that patients could complete a 
symptom screener on computer before seeing the doctor, which would indicate those diagnoses that are 
highly probable.  The clinician could use this information to guide the clinical interview and/or to 
confirm his or her findings and to provide routine outcome measurement.  Noting that the rules for 
developing a taxonomy that permits dimensions will not be simple or easy, he called for a systematic 
research effort using epidemiological survey data which contain both categorical diagnosis and 
dimensional measures on over 100,000 subjects. </p>
<p><strong>William T. Carpenter, Jr., MD</strong> (Catonsville, MD) presented on dimensional 
approaches and psychotic disorders.    He first summarized the presentation of 
<strong>Jim van Os, MD</strong> (Maastricht, the Netherlands) who was unable to attend the meeting at 
the last minute because of travel logistics.  Dr. Van Os noted that by focusing on the severely 
mentally ill, clinicians have a very biased view of psychiatric symptoms as they might occur in the 
general population.   Because phenotypes depend on multiple genes and their interaction with multiple 
environmental factors, behavioral traits tend to be widely distributed in populations without any 
points of rarity, which is ill-suited to a categorical conceptualization of mental illness.  Research 
suggests, for example, that major depression may be an arbitrary diagnostic convention imposed on a 
continuum of depressive symptoms, with subclinical manifestation of depression highly related to the 
incidence of major depressive disorder.  Dimensional approaches to psychotic disorders may be 
particularly useful as an indication of the need for treatment-the more dimensions that are present, 
the greater the unmet needs.  Dr. Carpenter then continued with his own presentation, noting that the 
heterogeneity among patients with schizophrenia reflects different interactions between genes and the 
environment and that the schizophrenia symptom areas can be reduced to three domains: psychotic 
symptoms, negative symptoms, and interpersonal problems.  He then discussed in detail a "deficit" 
subgroup of individuals with schizophrenia.  This subgroup has less depression, less suicidal 
ideation, less insight, more social and physical anhedonia, a different course of illness 
(e.g., poorer social function as compared to a non-deficit group), a different pattern of information 
processing problems, and a different neuroanatomy.  Furthermore, relatives of probands with the 
deficit syndrome tend to have more schizophrenia, more non-affective psychosis, and are more likely to 
themselves manifest the deficit subgroup of schizophrenia as compared to the relatives of non-deficit 
who have more affective psychosis.  Commenting on this presentation, <strong>Trisha Suppes, MD, 
PhD</strong> (Dallas, TX), noted that it is important to consider the relationship between dimensions 
and categories insofar as they would result in a change in treatment.  In this regard, the current 
categorical nature of psychosis is DSM-IV is potentially problematic because psychotic symptoms occur 
on a continuum.  At the most severe end are symptoms such as command hallucinations and delusions that 
drive one's behavior; in the middle are symptoms such as hearing whispers, grandiosity, and paranoia, 
and on the least severe end would be the phenomenon of hearing one's name called and fearfulness 
without frank paranoia.   Perhaps a dimensional approach to psychosis would encourage better 
recognition of a schizophrenia, psychotic depression, or bipolar psychosis prodrome which might lead 
to earlier therapeutic intervention. </p>
<p><strong>Katherine Shear, MD</strong> (New York, NY) presented a novel dimensional approach for 
anxiety disorders in the form of a panic-agoraphobic spectrum.   Because most patients present with an 
array of co-occurring symptoms and associated clinical features, the DSM diagnosis alone results in an 
oversimplification of clinical reality.  The spectrum model provides an operational system for 
describing a range of phenomena that are the presumed expression of psychopathological processes 
related to given DSM syndromal categories.  The panic-agoraphobic spectrum is a group of 114 typical 
and atypical panic-agoraphobic symptoms and related behavioral tendencies and temperament traits, 
grouped as separation sensitivity, stress sensitivity, medication/substance sensitivity, anxious 
expectation, illness phobia/hypochondriasis and reassurance orientation. The spectrum approach 
enhances the precision of categorical diagnoses by employing a wider band-width assessment of the 
array of clinical features associated with DSM.  This approach defines a  gradient of psychopathology 
within each category;  quantifies features of a given disorder to generate a novel dimensional 
measure; includes a broad array of features that provides a more sensitive threshold for clinically 
significant symptoms;  and offers the possibility of better identifying boundaries between disorders 
by evaluating multiple dimensions in a range of DSM disorders.  Furthermore, it is feasible to assess 
the panic-agoraphobia spectrum in clinical settings using a self-report instrument or a fifteen-minute 
interview.   Dr. Shear recommended that future research focus on analyses of existing spectrum data to 
further tease apart the boundaries of different spectrum features, and to identify features that can 
be used to guide management (e.g. treatment selection, targets, dose and termination decisions). </p>
<p><strong>Ingvar Bjelland, MD, PhD</strong> (Bergen, Norway) compared dimensional and categorical 
approaches to co-occurring anxiety and depressive symptoms by examining results from the HUNT study, 
a population-based general health survey conducted in Norway in the mid 1990's.   The survey included 
two 7-item subscales for anxiety and depression, as well as measures of subjective impairment.   
Dr. Bjelland concluded that given the loss of information caused by the categorization of continuously 
distributed phenomena, a dimensional approach was superior to the categorical approach in describing 
co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and depression and in predicting the impact of such co-occurrence.  
He noted that a future challenge is to determine the most characteristic symptom dimensions of anxiety 
and depression and how to measure them.</p>
<p><strong>Hans-Ulrich Wittchen, PhD</strong> (Dresden, Germany), discussing the anxiety disorder 
presentations, suggested that dimensional approaches offer several advantages over categorical 
approaches.  These include incorporating a greater amount of potentially relevant information 
(eg., severity), having better predictive and discriminating power, being more stable over time, 
being less affected by minor shifts in psychopathology, and having higher levels of reliability.  
Moreover, dimensional assessment is likely to be acceptable to both clinicians and researchers given 
that dimensional instruments (self-rated and clinician-rated) are available for various domains (e.g., 
somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety, panic, avoidance) and that dimensional approaches are the 
standard in clinical research (e.g., number of panic attacks).  He cautioned, however, that 
dimensional self-report scales have some significant limitations including difficulties in 
determining duration and persistence; and their almost exclusive focus on current state.   
Furthermore, the lumping together of the anxiety disorders based simply on factor analytic or 
taxonomic approaches of categorical diagnostic data seem to be premature and clinically of restricted 
value.   Unlike the fairly coherent unified domain of externalizing disorders (conduct disorder, 
antisocial PD, substance use disorders), there is little evidence for a clear structure of anxiety 
disorders.   Dr. Wittchen concluded that fuller understanding of the structure of mental disorders 
might require taking  into account the developmental pathways and the mechanisms involved in symptom 
progression.</p>
<p><strong>James Hudziak, MD</strong> (Burlington, VT) reviewed research evidence for a dimensional 
approach in developmental psychopathology.  Thousands of studies on child and adolescent 
psychopathology have used dimensional approaches in epidemiologic and clinical populations; many of 
these have combined and compared dimensional and categorical approaches.  The fact that categorical 
approaches fail to manage sources of variance that are important in child psychiatry further 
buttresses the case for use of dimensional approaches.  These sources of variance include 
developmental stage, gender, informant (teacher vs. parent vs. child), ethnicity, and comorbidity.  
A variety of standardized and epidemiologically normed dimensional/quantitative approaches have been 
developed for the study of developmental psychopathology.  For example, a study using the quantitative 
Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) scale demonstrated that teachers and parents had significant 
disagreements on whether and to what degree girls are aggressive.   Developmental stages are also 
important in understanding sources of variance, for example, in early childhood, 50% of the variance 
is due to genetic factors whereas in older age groups there is a remarkable reduction in genetic 
contributions to the development of aggression. In summary, Dr. Hudziak said that quantitative 
approaches, which already exist in child and adolescent psychiatry, are needed in order to incorporate 
potentially useful endophenotypic and genetic discoveries into psychiatric assessment approaches and 
that the taxonomy should not impede research discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas M. Achenbach, Ph.D</strong> (Burlington, VT) reviewed the use and usefulness of  
dimensional vs. categorical approaches to the diagnosis of externalizing disorders across the 
transition from childhood to adulthood.  Both "overt" and "covert" factors have been found in 
analyses of symptoms of conduct disorder (CD) in children and adolescents.  "Overt" symptoms include 
bullying, physical fighting, and cruelty to people and animals, conning, and destroying other's 
property.  "Covert" symptoms include stealing, staying out at night, running away from home and 
truancy.   These two patterns are not mutually exclusive and may be found simultaneously or at 
different stages of development.   Overt CD symptoms are strongly associated with the aggressive 
syndrome scale derived from the CBCL whereas covert symptoms are associated with the rule-breaking 
syndrome.  Longitudinal data reveal, however, that children who were aggressive at ages 13-16 evolved 
either into an aggressive adult behavior pattern or an intrusive adult syndrome (bragging, showing 
off, demanding attention) in which the more overtly aggressive behaviors disappear but socially 
obnoxious behaviors are retained.  Over a 10 year period, aggressive scores in female adolescents 
predicted substance abuse and disruptive behavior in adulthood.  However, rule breaking in adolescent 
males predicted disruptive behavior in adult males.  Furthermore, the aggressive syndrome has higher 
heritability than the rule-breaking syndrome.   Dr. Achenbach concluded from this data that although 
conduct disorder criteria can be quantified by computing symptom scores,  they should be separated 
into at least two patterns because of differences in features, predictive value, and heritability.</p>
<p>Commting on these presentations, <strong>Daniel Pine, MD</strong> (Bethesda, MD),  identified 
numerous advantages to integrating continuous approaches into a categorical system.  These include: 
1) the continuous nature of external validators (e.g., genetics); 2) the availability of rich data and 
the opportunity to integrate with work in typical development; 3) the prospect  of solving the 
problems with categorical cutoffs (e.g., below threshold cases can also be impaired); 4) their 
application to other developmental disorders (e.g., depression); and 5) the availability of 
perspectives from diseases in other branches of medicine (e.g., hypertension, obesity).  Perhaps the 
only disadvantage of continuous approaches (as opposed to categorical approaches) is that with limited 
resources, classification is needed to facilitate allocation of treatment.  Key questions that need to 
be addressed regarding the adoption of continuous approaches in the diagnosis of childhood disorders 
include: 1) how to integrate information across informants; 2) how to objectify age-related variations 
in scales; 3) how to accommodate multiple domains within each construct (e.g., for ADHD, there are 
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity domains; for conduct disorder there are  rule-violation, 
aggression, and emotional [i.e., lack of remorse] domains); and 4) how to integrate these approaches 
with neuroscience, where sometimes continua are evident (e.g., all children will have some level of 
improved attention after taking stimulants) and sometimes categories (e.g., improvement in mood after 
taking antidepressants occurs only in those children with a mood disorder).  While continuous 
approaches need to be part of a DSM-V, Dr. Pine concluded that it is hard to objectify how to do this 
and come up with really good rules that maximize the advantages of the continuous approach the 
nosology. </p>
<p><strong>Robert Krueger, PhD</strong> (Minneapolis, MN) presented on the research base for a 
dimensional approach to personality diagnosis in the DSM, noting that the first of the research 
planning conferences in the "Future of Psychiatric Diagnosis" series (which took place in December 
2004) focused on dimensional models of personality disorders.  Eighteen alternative dimensional models 
for personality were summarized at the meeting, raising the question about which dimensional system 
would be best for diagnosing personality disorders.  Although the various models appear to be 
superficially diverse, extensive evidence documents systematic links between the models, leading many 
investigators to believe that a hierarchical model can be developed that that integrates these 
models.  The top level of the hierarchy would have two dimensions, internalizing and externalizing, 
each of which would have two lower dimensions, emotional dysregulation and introversion vs. 
extraversion under internalizing, and impulsivity vs. constraint and antagonism vs. compliance under 
externalizing.  Beneath the four dimension level would be lower-level traits akin to the current 
personality disorder items (e.g., difficulty with intimacy may lie under the introversion/extraversion 
factor) which would facilitate clinically optimal conceptualization of specific patients.     This 
hierarchical structure reflects not only observable variation but also the underlying genetic risk 
factors, is also applicable to children and adolescents, and is applicable cross-culturally.   Dr. 
Krueger recommended that an integrative dimensional structure should be a starting point for the 
classification of personality disorders in DSM-V.   He proposed, however, that ultimately it will be 
necessary to reconsider the deeper structural aspects of the DSM given that the Axis I-II distinction 
is not highly compatible with the empirical organization of mental disorders.  Also, he said, 
augmenting DSM-V with dimensions would help to generate the data needed to formulate a "bottom-up" 
structural organization for DSM-VI.</p>
<p><strong>John Livesley, MD, PhD</strong> (Vancouver, Canada) presented on the clinical relevance of 
a proposed dimensional classification of personality disorder (PD).  He argued against just taking the 
DSM categories and converting them to a set of dimensions because they are not "natural kinds," not 
clinically useful, and provide poor coverage.  He proposed a two component structure for classifying 
PD: 1) developing diagnostic criteria for general PD; and 2) developing a system for representing 
individual differences in PD (different forms of disorder).   The DSM-IV definition of PD as 
maladaptive traits would be extended by defining the individual disorders as categories of primary 
traits.   For example, borderline personality disorder could be defined in terms of the primary traits 
of affective lability, impulsivity, cognitive dysregulation, insecure attachment, and self-harm.   Dr. 
Livesley then presented an example of this approach using the Dimensional Assessment of Personality 
Pathology (DAPP) Model, which contains 28 primary traits and four higher-order factors (emotional 
dysregulation, dissocial behavior/psychopathy, inhibitedness, and compulsivity).  He argued for the 
clinical utility of this dimensional approach on several grounds: 1) that it corrects coverage 
problems in the DSM (e.g., it  includes sadism and pessimistic anhedonia), 2) it allows for 
flexibility in assessment on either the higher-order factor level or the primary trait level, 3) most 
interventions for PD focus on specific symptom or behavior clusters (i.e., the primary traits) rather 
than global diagnoses; and 4) psychotherapeutic interventions are typically organized around 
incidents, scenarios, recurrent themes, and maladaptive cognitions which may represent the behavioral 
expressions of primary traits.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Skodol, MD</strong> (New York, NY), in his discussion, raised several issues and 
questions that will need to be addressed in the future: 1) although the dimensional models for PD 
converge on broad domains, they differ at trait/lower item levels, so ascertaining which of the many 
existing models to choose will be challenging;  2) how should comorbidity that occurs both within and 
across broad spectra be interpreted (e.g., comorbidity between mood disorders in the internalizing 
dimension and substance use in the externalizing dimension); 3) although traits long have been  
presumed to be stable over time, there is some evidence of change over time, raising the question of 
how to incorporate such change into conceptualizations of traits; 4) identifying and achieving 
consensus on the core features of any new global definition of PD; numerous features of  such a 
definition that could be dimensionalized - e.g., duration of traits, pervasiveness, inflexibility, 
distress, and functional impairment; and 5) given that personality disorders vary in dimensional 
complexity, it will be necessary to determine which traits are the most important and most useful. .   
Dr. Skodol concluded by suggesting that a personality disorder might possibly be reconceptualized as a 
combination of both enduring predispositions (static phenotypes) and characteristic behaviors (dynamic 
processes) and that it will be important to incorporate both static and dynamic elements when 
formulating a hybrid model for DSM-V.</p>
<p><strong>Maritza Rubio-Stipec, ScD</strong> (Arlington, VA) discussed how existing data can inform 
the revision of the nosology to include both categorical and dimensional diagnostic measures. In 
discussing the availability of epidemiological data sets to inform the dimensionality of disorders she 
highlighted the array of considerations that must be taken when using these data.  Although most 
existing information about the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders comes from structured diagnostic 
instruments that collect data on signs, symptoms and duration, they were designed to operationalize 
the DSM and ICD diagnostic systems by producing dichotomous diagnoses.  Dr. Rubio-Stipec advised that 
when developing dimensional measures, the diagnostic algorithms can be skipped in favor of using the 
raw data.   Caution should be exercised as the presence of skip patterns may affect the clustering of 
symptoms and thus the type of dimensional measure that can be generated with the existing data.   She 
also noted that certain aspects of the data sets might lend themselves to different types of analyses; 
for example, data sets that capture multiple diagnoses may be useful for studying diagnostic 
boundaries whereas data sets with only one or two disorders may allow for an analysis that goes deeper 
into the disorder.   She described a directory of data sets from different countries now being 
compiled by APIRE,  that is intended to inform the DSM-V workgroups about available data sources that 
could be used to develop dimensional approaches.   For each available data set, the directory 
describes the aim of the survey, the disorders included, the diagnostic instruments used, the target 
population, and the sampling strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Helena Kraemer, PhD</strong> (Palo Alto, CA) discussed statistical "tactics" and questions 
to be considered when doing research on dimensional approaches.  Among these:  1) Once items are 
selected, do they tap one dimension, two dimensions, or more?;    2) In doing a factor analysis, if 
only one factor emerges then go on.  If more than one factor emerges, split the list of items and deal 
with each separately.  3) Are the items in the dimension reliable?  If not, either reframe the 
questions assessing the item or else discard the item.  4)  If items are redundant to each other, the 
redundant item should be either reframed or discarded.   5) When considering how to scale individual 
items, item response theory can be helpful, with more difficult or discriminative items scored more 
heavily.   It is important, however, to insure that the scaling is as simple as possible to make it 
clinically useful.  6) Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis can be used to establish optimal cut 
points by showing the correspondence between the binary DSM-V diagnosis and a proposed DSM-V ordinal 
diagnosis, with the higher the ROC curve the better the correspondence between the binary and ordinal 
diagnosis.   For optimal effect, ROC analysis should be done for various populations (men/women, 
ethnic groups, different countries, socio-economic status, community, high risk groups, and clinical 
samples) and for various usages:  screening (sensitivity), discrimination, definitive diagnosis 
(specificity).   Each of these combinations may or may not identify a different cut point.   7) When 
looking at a dimensional measure to determine whether there is one disorder or two, there is one 
disorder if there are shared risk factors, if one leads to the other (i.e., multiple stages of one 
disorder) or if the same treatment principles apply. </p>
<p>Following these presentations and commentaries, the participants reconvened in six breakout groups 
corresponding to the six diagnostic areas; each group was asked to select one diagnosis in DSM and to 
develop a concrete proposal for a dimensional approach that might serve to help future DSM workgroups 
visualize the feasibility of introducing dimensional components to the diagnostic system.   (The 
proposals are summarized in the table below).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The externalizing disorders of childhood breakout group used ADHD as an exemplar.  A number of 
quantitative scales are available to measure ADHD symptoms and functioning.  When setting categorical 
thresholds to determine caseness and treatment, it may be that thresholds should differ by age, 
gender, informants, and culture/ethnicity.   Furthermore, severity can be considered at the symptom 
level (which is often presented in terms of frequency) or at the syndrome level, in which the overall 
impact on functioning is considered.  Regarding the practical issue of how to implement a dimensional 
approach in clinical settings, the group noted that a dimensional approach could actually reduce the 
workload for clinicians especially in settings where data collection is automated, given that parent 
and teacher reports have been shown to be highly predictive of clinical diagnoses of ADHD.</p></li>
<li><p>The personality disorders breakout group proposed a dimensional model that used roughly 28 
personality descriptive facets based on the empirical literature for fine-grained personality 
description.  For the clinician using the DSM, each facet could be rated on a 3 point scale with 
scales varying by facet (i.e., some bipolar, some unipolar).  A profile of scores across the 28 
facets could then provide clinically useful dimensional data on personality description which can be 
summarized into the four broad domains described previously.   The group also recommended the 
development of general criteria for personality disorder that go beyond personality description and 
that could include elements such as requiring a disturbance of self and interpersonal relations, 
having a minimum level of impairment (perhaps rated on a scale such as the SOFAS), requiring that it 
be present more often than not for at least a certain number of years, and requiring that it not be 
due to some other reason (e.g., chronic substance use).</p></li>
<li><p>The substance disorders breakout group selected alcohol dependence as its focus and suggested 
a bottom-up, data-based development of criteria.  The process could begin by using the existing 
DSM-IV criteria as a starting point and then creating possible new criteria (e.g., measure of 
substance consumption, craving, rapid reinstatement), eliminating candidate criteria that are 
uninformative or questionably relevant to the diagnosis, rare, highly unreliable, or redundant with 
other criteria.    Criteria could then be dimensionalized using a 3 point scale (i.e., no/mild/severe, 
or never/sometimes/frequent).   Then, instead of a committee setting the diagnostic thresholds in 
advance, thresholds could be determined in a more empirical fashion, with different thresholds 
depending on the population of interest (e.g., community, clinical, high-risk), the purpose (severity, 
impairment, diagnostic certainty), developmental level (e.g., adolescents vs. adults), demography 
(e.g., gender, race) and the development of new findings (e.g., candidate genes).</p></li>
<li><p>The anxiety disorders breakout group noted that shared features of anxiety disorders could 
easily be dimensionalized across these disorders. Among the shared elements are panic, anticipatory 
anxiety, avoidance behavior, and other dysphoric affects.. Although it is neither feasible nor useful 
at this time to attempt to reconfigure anxiety disorders based on dimensional ratings of core 
symptoms, the use of such an approach by researchers could be advantageous.  Instruments already exist 
to assess each of these elements, although they vary in degree of practicality.  Panic spectrum 
assessment, a dimensional measure of panic-related symptoms, has been shown by researchers to be an 
important predictor of illness severity and treatment outcomes.  Although requiring dimensional 
measures of all features of all anxiety disorders is not practical for routine clinical purposes at 
this time, where simple instruments are available, these could be recommended as an enhancement to 
categorical diagnosis. Using panic disorder as an example, the group identified the Panic Disorder 
Severity Scale (PDSS) because it is sensitive to treatment response, is a simple way of 
operationalizing severity, has a 1-month time frame, and includes defined anchor points (0-4).  A 
further way that dimensional assessment could be useful in anxiety disorders would be to adopt a 
staging approach to illness, similar to that used in other areas of medicine to inform treatment 
decisions and predict course.  Again using panic disorder as an example, dimensional assessment of 
panic, anxiety, phobia and other psychopathology, could lead to the ability to stage the evolution of 
the disorder, with stage 1 being isolated panic attacks, stage 2 panic disorder, uncomplicated, and 
stage 3 panic disorder complicated by other problems such as agoraphobia, other anxiety or depressive 
disorders, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The mood disorders breakout group proposed adding dimensionality to major depressive disorder 
by exploring the implications of adopting the PHQ-9, a nine-item self-report scale with a 0-27 range 
of scores.   Used as a severity measure,  suggested cutpoints include 5-9 for mild, 10-14 for 
moderate, 15-19 for moderately severe, and 20 or greater for severe, with "significantly improved" 
defined as a 5-point drop after 6 weeks, "responded to treatment" as a 50% drop in score, and 
"remission of depression" as a score of less than 5.  Such an approach has clinical utility in that 
it can identify probable cases, it identifies cases at risk who need referral, it confirmed current 
treatment in 60% of cases, it informed a change of treatment in 40% of cases, and in  &gt;90% of visits, 
clinicians rated it as useful.  It has research utility in that it sets benchmarks for improvement, 
recovery, and remission and permits clinical audits of practice.   The scale still needs validation in 
different settings and with different types of patients (e.g., high risk patients with comorbid 
conditions).</p></li>
<li><p>The psychotic disorders breakout group recommended that DSM should assess a variety of 
domains relevant for care in a quantitative fashion, using a simple scale.  The final quantitative 
scores for DSM purposes should be made by the clinician and may be based on a variety of information 
ranging from clinical observation to sophisticated, computer-based measurements.   Diagnostic-specific 
domains could include deficiency in reality testing, disorganization of thought, cognitive 
dysfunction, negative symptoms (avolition, anhedonia), and social impairment.   Treatment-relevant 
domains include affective disturbances, activities of daily life, social support networks/assets, 
participation in productive activities, and substance use.  For example, for the domain of reality 
testing there are numerous validated research-level measures available (e.g., BPRS, PANSS).  Ancillary 
information may include a full, research-level assessment if available and if ustified by the purpose 
and resources, but the final decision about the domain score will be made by the clinician.</p></li>
